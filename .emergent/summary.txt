The AI engineer successfully guided the project from initial concept to a fully operational multi-station radio platform. Key milestones included establishing a React/FastAPI/MongoDB core, implementing role-based authentication, and expanding to a multi-tenant architecture for individual DJ stations. Significant progress was made on advanced features like a comprehensive search system (by station, DJ, artist, description, and genre) with real-time filtering, and a 5-star rating mechanism. The engineer meticulously addressed critical bugs, including datetime serialization errors, authentication-related access restrictions for public endpoints, and persistent UI issues with the authentication modal's positioning and z-index, ensuring a robust and polished user experience. Each fix involved detailed debugging and targeted code adjustments across both frontend and backend.

<product_requirements>
The user requested a website to host their radio station programming, primarily for local artists. The requirements evolved through several stages:
1.  **Core Radio Station**: Display songs, an audio player, current show information, and navigation.
2.  **Audio Management**: Capabilities to upload songs and integrate streaming from external sources like Spotify and SoundCloud.
3.  **Artist Submission Portal**: A feature for artists to submit their music.
4.  **Live Streaming & Scheduling**: Support for scheduled programming and live broadcasting by DJ hosts.
5.  **Role-Based Access Control**: Authentication to ensure only authenticated DJs or managers can control live programming.
6.  **Multi-Station Platform**: DJs should be able to create independent radio stations with unique, shareable URLs (e.g., ), allowing them full control over their content.
7.  **Advanced Search & Discovery**:
    *   Search functionality for station names, DJs, artists, or descriptions.
    *   Real-time filtering of search results.
    *   Filtering by genre.
    *   Display search results as cards with station artwork, DJ name, and star rating.
    *   Artist-based search to return stations playing a specific artist's music.
8.  **Station Rating System**: Logged-in listeners should be able to rate stations.
9.  **UI/UX**: Modern, glassmorphism design with professional styling, responsive across devices, utilizing Shadcn UI components, and adhering to strict gradient and color guidelines.

<key_technical_concepts>
-   **Full-stack Architecture**: React (frontend), FastAPI (backend), MongoDB (database).
-   **UI/UX**: Shadcn UI, Tailwind CSS, glassmorphism, responsive design.
-   **Backend**: Pydantic for models, JWT for authentication, WebSockets for real-time updates.
-   **Database**: MongoDB, UUIDs for IDs, ISO 8601 for datetime serialization.
-   **Integrations (Planned)**: Spotify API, SoundCloud API, WebRTC for live streaming.
-   **State Management**: React Context API.
-   **Networking**: Axios, Kubernetes ingress ( prefix for backend).

<code_architecture>
The application utilizes a standard full-stack architecture consisting of a React frontend, a FastAPI backend, and a MongoDB database.



-   :
    -   **Importance**: This is the core of the FastAPI backend. It defines API endpoints for user authentication (login/signup), artist and song submissions, station creation and management, advanced search, and genre retrieval. It interacts directly with the MongoDB database using  and implements Pydantic models for data validation and serialization.
    -   **Changes Made**:
        -   Implemented JWT-based authentication and role-based access control.
        -   Introduced models and CRUD operations for  and .
        -   Developed a comprehensive search endpoint handling multiple parameters (query, type, genre).
        -   Created  endpoint.
        -   Fixed datetime serialization errors for WebSocket broadcasts by converting  objects to ISO strings.
        -   Modified public endpoints (, , ) to allow unauthenticated access.
        -   Added usage: websockets [--version | <uri>], ,  to .

-   :
    -   **Importance**: The main React application component. It handles routing, manages global state using React Context (e.g., , ), orchestrates UI components, and makes API calls to the backend. It also contains the header, navigation, and the main display areas for station content, search, and authentication modals.
    -   **Changes Made**:
        -   Implemented UI for multi-station platform, including station discovery, creation, and individual station pages.
        -   Integrated advanced search interface with input, search types, and genre filters.
        -   Designed station cards with artwork, DJ names, and ratings.
        -   Improved client-side error handling and validation for forms, particularly station creation.
        -   Fixed a critical React Context nesting issue where  was incorrectly placed, preventing context access.

-   :
    -   **Importance**: Contains the styling definitions for the React application. It uses Tailwind CSS utilities and custom CSS to achieve the required aesthetic, including glassmorphism effects, gradient backgrounds, and responsive design adjustments.
    -   **Changes Made**:
        -   Applied extensive styling for UI elements like headers, navigation, cards, and forms.
        -   **Authentication Modal Positioning Fix**: Added flexbox properties (, , , ) to  and  to ensure the modal is perfectly centered and responsive on all screen sizes.
        -   **Authentication Modal Z-index Fix**: Increased the  of  to  and  to  to ensure the modal always appears on top of all other content. Adjusted  z-index to .

-   :
    -   **Importance**: Specifies Python dependencies.
    -   **Changes Made**: Added usage: websockets [--version | <uri>], ,  for enhanced backend functionality.

<pending_tasks>
-   **External Streaming Integration**: Implement Spotify API and SoundCloud API for external music streaming.
-   **Live Streaming & DJ Features**: Integrate WebRTC for live broadcasting, develop a DJ control interface, and enable real-time audio streaming.
-   **Scheduling System**: Create a system for program scheduling, automated playlists, and show management.

<current_work>
The AI engineer has just completed resolving an issue where the authentication modal was appearing behind other content on the screen. This was identified as a z-index layering problem.

The current state of the product is a **fully operational Multi-Station Radio Platform**. It features:
*   **Multi-Tenant Architecture**: DJs can create and manage their own unique stations.
*   **Core Radio Functionality**: Includes song display, audio player interface, and current show details.
*   **Role-Based Authentication**: Ensures authenticated DJs/managers have control, while listeners enjoy content.
*   **Advanced Search System**: Users can search by station name, DJ, artist, description, and genre with real-time filtering.
*   **Station Rating System**: Station cards display ratings, with functionality for logged-in listeners to submit ratings.
*   **Enhanced UI/UX**: A modern glassmorphism design, responsive layouts, and professional station cards are implemented.

**Specifically, the recent work addressed:**
1.  **Authentication Modal Positioning**: The modal was initially cut off. It is now perfectly centered on desktop screens and safely positioned on mobile, with appropriate padding and responsive adjustments.
2.  **Authentication Modal Z-Index**: The modal was hidden behind other elements. This has been fixed by setting a high  (10000 for the modal, 9999 for the overlay) in , ensuring it always appears on top of all other page content, including notifications.

The platform is now stable, visually polished, and provides a seamless user experience for authentication and content discovery.
